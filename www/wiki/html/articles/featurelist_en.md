# Paracraft Creative Software ![](http://git.keepwork.com/gitlab_rls_kaitlyn/keepworkdatasource/raw/master/kaitlyn_images/img_1502354864492.jpeg)




<p style="font-size:30px;">Free 3D movie making tool</p>


Paracraft is a free movie making tool for the public. You can use it to create 3D scenes and roles, make animations and movies, learn software programming, and publish your works.

- Use blocks to build 3D models and worlds

- Use bone blocks to define joints

- Turn a set of blocks into a BMAX model

- BMAX models can be used as normal blocks, as well as actors in movie blocks

- Make animation with movie block. A movie blocks includes a video camera, actors, captions, sounds, and other movie blocks

- Record animation with actors' movements, such as walking, running, and jumping

- Subtle and precise adjustment of actor joints along the time axis

- Connect several movie blocks together to make one movie

- **Free and open source**: Paracraft uses the programming language of NPL. You can program plugins and apps with NPL's internal editor or visual studio

- **For education**: more people can learn software programming on their own, and publish their works online

# Learn the NPL Programming Language ![](http://git.keepwork.com/gitlab_rls_kaitlyn/keepworkdatasource/raw/master/kaitlyn_images/img_1503309070762.jpeg)




<p style="font-size:30px;">Paracraft, KeepWork, Haqi are all created with the NPL programming language.</p>


Neural Parallel Language(NPL) is an open source and high performance general purpose scripting language. Its syntax is compatible with lua and thus easy to learn. NPL runtime environment provides core libraries, which can be used to develop complex 3D/2D GUI apps or high concurrency cross-platform apps.



- NPL is an open source general purpose programming language. Its syntax is 100% compatible with lua, with its own extensions

- NPL runtime environment includes an embedded ParaEngine game engine, which provides core libraries for developing 3D/2D/web apps as well as server software

- NPL provides rich C/C++ APIs and open source NPL script libraries

- NPL provides one stop solution for programming advanced interactive GUI apps, complex 3D apps based on opengl/directX, high concurrency and extensible web servers, high performance database, and distributed software frameworks. It is cross-platform, extensible, fast, scalable, and easy to debug 

- NPL started from a brain simulation project in 2004. In NPL, file nodes and connections are universal. Developers don't need knowledge of multi-threading and networking to develop complex high performance network applications

- NPL supports pre-emptive and non pre-emptive coding in user mode, and can build a large number of virtual threads using a single thread

- NPL is a weak typing scripting language, but its jit compiling makes its performance close to C++; through ffi or its extension interface, it can call C++ functions and vice-versa

# NPL CAD ![](http://git.keepwork.com/gitlab_rls_kaitlyn/keepworkdatasource/raw/master/kaitlyn_images/img_1502354911117.jpeg)




<p style="font-size:30px;">CAD software based on NPL</p>

Most of commodities today, such as cups, phones, and automobiles, are designed by CAD software. But traditional CAD software is too complicated to operate and difficult to learn. In NPL CAD, CAD functions are achieved through software coding, and we are adding more modules to the library. Programmers usually can master NPL CAD in around 30 mins. 

- CAD model building through coding

- You can learn software programming through CAD, learning both at the same time

- Rich 2D,3D model building commands

- Convenient 3D preview and debugging

- CAD model can be 3d printed, or imported into a Paracraft world to be used as a bmax model

- We are building professional CAD model libraries and algorithm libraries with NPL

# Open Education Platform  ![](http://git.keepwork.com/gitlab_rls_kaitlyn/keepworkdatasource/raw/master/kaitlyn_images/img_1502422235342.jpeg)


<p style="font-size:30px;">To build an open education platform that is centered on self-learning, with published works on the platform as the means of evaluation.</p>

KeepWork's mission is to build a knowledge sharing platform. Users can also publish their works to build up their portfolios on KeepWork. Everyone can teach themselves, and everyone can be a teacher. People learn through creative works, and by sharing their works online, their works become other people's teacher.

- We think 3 languages are the base of education and creation: Chinese, English, and the software programming language. We hope more and more young people can learn of software programming to create their works on our education platform

- We are opening 3 schools with Beijing Open University. We hope to explore a new online education and evaluation model based on self-learning and creative works, people learning from and being friends with each other for their lives

- PAC, e.g. Paracraft Animation Contest, held twice a year, is for the primary and middle school students and college students. Its purpose is to let the participants learn of software programming and 3D animation making through Paracraft, build meaningful works and share their works on the internet in the open source way. Furthermore, attending PAC contest is the only way to graduate from the Creative Academy
